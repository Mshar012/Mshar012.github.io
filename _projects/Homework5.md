# Plot 1: Number of Buildings by agency 

<vegachart schema-url="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plot/bar.json" style="width: 100%; height: 500px;"></vegachart>

This bar chart reflects the number of buildings managed by each Illinois state agency. I used Altair to encode the agency names on the x-axis and the number of buildings on the y-axis, sorting the values in descending order to enhance readability. By examining the chart, we can easily identify which agencies manage the most buildings; for example, the Department of Natural Resources has the highest count. The agency names are encoded as nominal data, while the y-axis uses a quantitative count aggregation. The only data transformation I applied was the default grouping performed by Altairâ€™s count() function.

# Plot 2: Distribution of Buildings Across Cities by Agency 

<vegachart schema-url="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/plot/hist.json" style="width: 100%; height: 500px;"></vegachart>

Write up for the 2nd Plot:

This interactive histogram displays the number of buildings by city, filtered by agency. It allows users to easily identify where a specific agency has the highest number of buildings. The x-axis represents city names (nominal), while the y-axis shows the count of buildings (quantitative). To add interactivity, I included a dropdown menu that enables users to select an agency and instantly view how its buildings are distributed across different cities.
